               <div class="history-text">
                  <p>Coffee is believed to have originated in Ethiopia, specifically in a region known as Kefa or
                     Kaffa. Wild coffee plants grew there, and it is thought that the local people discovered the
                     stimulating effects of coffee by observing the behavior of goats that consumed the coffee
                     berries. The exact timeline and domestication of coffee plants remain unclear, but by the 15th
                     century, coffee cultivation and consumption had spread to the Arabian Peninsula. <br>

                     In the Islamic world, coffee became popular and coffeehouses, known as "qahveh khaneh," emerged
                     as important social and intellectual centers. Coffee was seen as a beverage that promoted
                     alertness and facilitated conversations. It was through trade routes that coffee made its way to
                     Europe in the 16th century. The first coffeehouse in Europe opened in Venice in 1645, and from
                     there, coffeehouses spread across the continent, becoming hubs of social gatherings and
                     intellectual discussions. <br>

                     During the age of European colonial expansion, coffee plantations were established in various
                     regions, including the Americas, Africa, and Asia, to meet the growing demand for coffee. This
                     expansion led to the rise of coffee as a commodity and the establishment of coffee as a major
                     global industry.

                     The Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries brought advancements in coffee
                     production and brewing methods. Commercial coffee roasting and grinding machines were
                     introduced, making coffee more accessible to the masses. <br> Coffee became a staple beverage
                     for people worldwide.

                     In the 20th century, coffee culture continued to evolve. Specialty coffee emerged, with a focus
                     on high-quality beans, precise brewing techniques, and appreciation for the unique flavors and
                     characteristics of different coffee origins. Today, coffee plays a significant role in many
                     cultures around the world, with a wide variety of brewing methods, coffeehouses, and specialty
                     coffee shops offering a diverse range of flavors and experiences.</p>

                  <p>First, you need to choose your coffee beans. There are many varieties to choose from, each

               <div class="all-step">
                  <p>Once you have your beans, you'll need to grind them. You can use a burr grinder, blade
                     grinder,
                     or even a manual grinder. The grind size should be suitable for your brewing method. For
                     example, for a French press, you'll want a coarse grind, while for an espresso machine,
                     you'll
                     need a fine grind.</p>

                     depend on
                     your personal preference and the equipment you have on hand. Some popular methods include
                     using
                     a French press, pour-over, or an automatic coffee maker.</p>

                     <p>This is one of the oldest ways to make coffee. The coffee grounds are boiled in water,
                        allowing the flavors to fully infuse. The Turkish coffee method falls under this
                        category,
                        where finely ground coffee is boiled in a special pot called a 'cezve'.

                        the most popular method in this category. The coffee and water are steeped together for
                        several minutes, then the plunger is pressed to separate the grounds from the liquid.

                     <p>In these methods, hot water is poured over coffee grounds in a filter, and gravity
                        pulls
                        the
                        water through the coffee, extracting its flavors. The resulting coffee is clear and
                        clean-tasting. Examples include the Pour-Over method and the use of automatic drip
                        coffee
                        makers.

                     <p>In these methods, water is forced through coffee grounds under pressure, which tends to
                        produce a stronger, more robust coffee. Espresso is the most well-known pressure
                        brewing
                        method.

                     <p>This method involves steeping coffee grounds in room temperature or cold water for an
                        extended period (usually 12-24 hours), then filtering out the grounds for a clean cup
                        of
                        coffee. It's a great way to reduce the coffee's acidity and bring out its natural
                        sweetness.
